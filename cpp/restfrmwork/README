Here is a samll example for how we can create a REST server using available
http library in C/C**. 
Here we are using libmicrohttpd (http://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/)
as the http library. But any other library of your choice can be used for the
same.
We will create JSON or XML data as API responeses. Boost property tree is used
for generating XML/JSON data
(http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/doc/html/property_tree.html).

REST allows all HTTP methods such as GET,POST,PUT,DELETE etc. But for
demonstration purpose we will only use GET method. Also, we will support only
http and not https. In next post, I will demonstrate how to use https for secure
data transfer for this example.

***PLEASE download and build libmicrohttpd, boost library as we need them to
compile and run this example.***

The examples defines three simple APIs or resources.
sysinfo 
diskinfo
procinfo

sysinfo returns few system related information of your Linux box. It optioanlly
takes three flags "cpus", "memory", "os" as the value of parameter "fields", so
that user can select a set of information. All the APIs take another parameter
"type" to select the response format and valid values are JSON or XML.

diskinfo returns few disks related information of your Linux box. It optioanlly
takes two flags "totalparts", "spaceinfo" as the value of parameter "fields", so
that user can select a set of information.

procinfo returns few processes related information about the processes runnining
on your Linux box. It also takes three flags "percentmemory", "percentcpu" as the 
values for parameter "fields", so that user can select a set of information.

We need to compile the exmaples as shown below (assuming you built and installed
libmicrohttpd in /usr/local)g** httphandler.cpp  strutil.cpp  api.cpp executor.cpp -I \
g++ httphandler.cpp  strutil.cpp  api.cpp executor.cpp -I \
     /usr/local/lib -lmicrohttpd \
     <Path to Directory containing libboost_regex.a>libboost_regex.a

After we build the example, we run it as shown below
$ exectuable_name_for_our_example port_number_where_it_listens
E.g.
$ ./example_rest_server 1234

We access the API as shown below:
http://127.0.0.1:1234/procinfo?type=xml&fields=percentcpu,percentmemory
http://127.0.0.1:1234/procinfo?type=json&fields=percentcpu
http://127.0.0.1:1234/diskinfo
http://127.0.0.1:1234/sysinfo?fields=memory

Point your browser to any of the above locations and see the responses :)
